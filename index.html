        <h2>Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) Game Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        The goal of the game is to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O")
        in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.
        <h3>Setup</h3>
        The game is played on a 3x3 grid. One player is "X" and the other is
        "O". Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square.

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        You can use your mouse to enter "O" or "X" in the box. Decide who goes
        first (usually "X" starts). Players take turns placing their mark ("X"
        or "O") in any empty square. Winning the game: The first player to get
        three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If
        all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw. You
        can reset your game in the middle of you game by clicking on "Reset
        Game" button. If one player is win or game is draw then you can restart
        the game by clicking "start new game".
